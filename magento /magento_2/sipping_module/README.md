# Simple magento 2 shipping module

Module Create new shipping method , it shows shipping amount based on product attribute set . Shipping amount is set to 0 for all other product . The attribute id for which shipping has to be charged is hardcoded in the module so you will need to change that accordingly and Price could be set from the backend though .
